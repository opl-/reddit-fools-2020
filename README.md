# Reddit April Fools 2020

This repository contains my code and other junk I made for the 2020 Reddit April Fools.

* `docs-gremlins.md` contains a documentation/analysis of the `gremlins-api.reddit.com` website.
* `userscript-and-memories.md` contains an explanation of the userscript I wrote, blinky lights, and my thoughts on the event.
* `imposter.user.js` is the userscript that was just mentioned.
* `data/` contains the data I saved (in several different formats). I don't really plan to use it in any way, but at some point I decided to save some of it just in case. It's a mess.
